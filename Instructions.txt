This program outputs the optimal path (one which takes the least time) given a tile based maze.
The mazes must be given as input through text files. Each text file must contain a number specifying
the length of the square grid followed by the maze.

Mazes can contain the following characters :

'S' and 'E' stand for start and exit locations respectively.

'X' represents a wall which is an impassable barrier.

'_' represents free tile. It takes 1 sec to move from one free tile to the other.

'g' represents a gum. It slows you down to half the speed for the next 2 moves.
    Gums do not stack ie going through multiple ones only refreshes the duration.
    
'p' represents a portal. There can be 2 of these on a maze. Activating one will
    teleport you into another in 1 sec. The player can choose to activate it if 
    it helps him to minimize the time.

In the final optimal path '_' which are traversed are replaced with '.' while
portals and gums ('p' and 'g') are capitalized if they are traversed.
