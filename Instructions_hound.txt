Problem : 
The player has to escape the maze by taking a valid path from his starting 
location to an exit location while a hound tries to catch him. 
A valid path  is one in which the player can escape for any possible path of the hound. 
The hound can choose to either directly go to the exit or search for the player. 
A path is not valid if the hound can either reach the exit before him or can catch 
him before he reaches the exit. 
If the hound lands on a tile which the player had previously been on then it catches 
his scent and follows him with twice its initial speed.

The mazes must be given as input through text files.Each text file must contain a number 
specifying the length of the square grid followed by the maze.

Mazes can contain the following characters :

'S' and 'E' stand for start and exit locations respectively.
'X' represents a wall which is an impassable barrier.
'H' represents the starting location of the hound.

The program first prints all the valid paths in the form of row and column 
coordinates of tiles on the path (row,column).
It then shows the shortest valid path on the maze by indicating the path with the character '.'.
